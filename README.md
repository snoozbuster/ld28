@snoozbuster and @Core43's entry for Ludum Dare 28!

Due to copyright concerns, or something to that effect, the music's artist didn't want me to commit the music. However, you can download it at http://luminescentbreakfast.bandcamp.com/. Unfortunately, you'll need to follow these instructions:
- convert both to WMA
- Focus becomes main.wma and Underlying becomes not-main.wma
- Both go in Content/music

The sound effects are assets from our commercial game, Accelerated Delivery, as well, so we'd appreciate it if you didn't use those in your own projects. I believe the originals are from www.soundjay.com though (don't quote me on that) so you could always head over there.
